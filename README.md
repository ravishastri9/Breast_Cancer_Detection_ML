According to research, experienced physician can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while using machines learning techniques it provides an accuracy of 91 percent. In this work, machine learning techniques has been applied which includes K- nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree Classifier (DT).To predict whether the case is benign or malignant we have used the breast cancer dataset. The DTC classifier gives more accurate and precise results as compared to others, and this classifier is trained with the larger datasets.

### OBJECTIVES
•	Implementing machine learning algorithms to larger datasets helps to improve the accuracy of results.

•	Using of ml techniques gives more precise results than experienced physicians.

•	It reduces overfitting.
